<a href="http://glasscanvas.io/" target="_blank">E.I.Lab</a> is a Media Art Labortory which is interested in Human emotion recognition. As a Programmer, I made robots arousing human feelings with using Real-time sound processing and Deep learning technologies. Also I was an instructor for Media Art classes and Creator classes.
